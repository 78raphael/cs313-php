  $intro .= "<p>My name is Jay Johnson. I am originally from New Mexico, but am currently living in the Phoenix, AZ area, in a town named San Tan Valley. My wife and I have been married since 2013 and we have 3 years old twins, a boy and a girl, and a new kid, currently 5 months old. We love them and they are lots of work and lots of fun.</p>
  <p>I am currently employed with Apple Inc and have been for over 10 years. I graduated from BYU-Provo with a degree in Information Technology but have decided to come back to school for a 2nd degree in Web Development, as that's what I'm currently doing for my job.</p>";

  $intro .= "<p>Outside of work and school, my family love going to the park and playing outside, whenever the Arizona weather will allow us. Before kids, my wife and I would often cheer on our local MLB team, the Arizona Diamondbacks. We've not made it to the stadium as much now that we have kids, but we are still fans.</p>";

  $intro .= "<p>We love watching comic book movies and are in the process of fully indoctrinating our kids with Marvel, Star Wars, and all things awesome. My favorite superhero since I was kid is Spider-Man.</p>";
